Yo,

    DZSlides is a HTML template to build slides in HTML5 and CSS3.
    'template.html' is the only file you need.
    Shells are extensions. You don't need them for a basic usage.
    For a complete presentation, see: http://paulrouget.com/dzslides.

    See 'examples/readme/slides.html' to start.
